<h1>The Best Movies According To Orlando </h1>

<h2>My Top 3 Movies Of All Time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Fight Club</h3>

<p>One of the classics. It gives an indepth view of our values as humans in mondern society</p>

<H3>Pirates of The Carribean</H3>

<p>One of my favourites as kid, it has a symolic meaning for me as it reminds me of my dreams as a teenager</p>

<H3>Parasite</H3>

<p>Not necessarily one of my top 3 of all time, it's the last film I remember enjoying</p>
